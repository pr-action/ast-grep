language: go
message: >-
  Detected use of the 'none' algorithm in a JWT token.
  The 'none' algorithm assumes the integrity of the token has already
  been verified. This would allow a malicious actor to forge a JWT token
  that will automatically be verified. Do not explicitly use the 'none'
  algorithm. Instead, use an algorithm such as 'HS256'.

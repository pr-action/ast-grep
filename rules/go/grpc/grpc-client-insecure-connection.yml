severity: warning
message: >-
  Found an insecure gRPC connection using 'grpc.WithInsecure()'. This creates a
  connection without encryption to a gRPC
  server. A malicious attacker could tamper with the gRPC message, which could compromise
  the machine. Instead, establish
  a secure connection with an
  SSL certificate using the 'grpc.WithTransportCredentials()' function. You can
  create a create credentials using a 'tls.Config{}'
  struct with 'credentials.NewTLS()'. The final fix looks like this: 'grpc.WithTransportCredentials(credentials.NewTLS(<config>))'.
